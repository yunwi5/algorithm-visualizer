* Compare the runtime of different sorting algorithms side by side.
* Each color represents different operations such as initial, pending, comparison, swapped etc.
* Info icon on the top right pops up the modal that explains these algorithms & animations in detail.

* Compare the runtime of two main search algorithms that are BinarySearch and LinearSearch.
* Pause & Reset functionalities that allow you to stop the execution or reset the execution.
* Info icon on the top right pops up the modal that explains these algorithms & animations in detail.

* Run the sudoku simulation that uses back-tracking algorithm to solve the sudoku puzzle by itself.
* Try the sudoku puzzle on your own by clicking the 'Try Yourself' button.
* Info icon on the top right pops up the modal that explains the sudoku section in detail.

## Getting Started

For the development server,

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

For the production server,
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
